| Architecture Type | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| [**One-Tier Architecture**](One_Tier/one_tier.md) | A single-layer architecture where the application and database reside on the same machine. |
| [**Two-Tier Architecture**](Two_Tier/two_tier.md) | Divides the application into a client and a server, with the database usually residing on the server. |
| [**Three-Tier Architecture**](Three_Tier/three_tier.md) | Separates the application into three layers: presentation, logic, and data, typically hosted on different servers. |
| [**N-Tier Architecture**](N_Tier/n_tier.md) | Extends the three-tier architecture to include more layers, enhancing scalability and flexibility. |
| [**Serverless Architecture**](Serverless/serverless.md) | Runs applications without managing the underlying infrastructure, relying on cloud services to handle server provisioning and scaling. |
| [**Microservices Architecture**](Microservices/microservices.md) | Breaks down applications into small, loosely coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. |
| [**Event-Driven Architecture**](Event_Driven/event_driven.md) | Uses events to trigger and communicate between decoupled services, allowing for more responsive and scalable systems. |
| [**Hybrid Architecture**](Hybrid/hybrid.md) | Combines multiple architectural styles to leverage the benefits of each, often mixing on-premises and cloud environments. |
